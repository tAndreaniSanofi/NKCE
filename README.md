# NKCE
Notebook and computational analysis workstream for **NK cell engager multi-modal data analysis (scRNA-seq+CITE-seq)**. This repository contains command lines bioinformatics software run in parallel for the quantification of spliced and un-spliced reads on bam files for the RNA velocity analysis [La Manno et al 2018](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0414-6). Furthermore, it containts notebook to **model the quantifed reads and conduct trajectories analysis**.  

### Analysis starts with exon and introns quantification
